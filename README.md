A jump, run and collect **game** about a strolling cat fighting and chasing her way through the night. 
 
This **game** is my first project using *javascript and p5*, also learning some *DOM manipulation*. It was a really fun project to build.
 
Would say itâ€™s Inspired by **Super Mario** and **Agar.io** in *cheap* and *different*.
Use the **Arrows** to move around, and collect the **food** *be aware, that **one pill makes you smaller** and the **rotten fish makes you many***. 
Find the entry to the second level and **fight** *and jump with space* all pigeons before they overrule you!
 
For best resolution play with the browser on full screen and turn up the volume!
